# massachusetts-covid19-report-archive

A csv file and archive of daily reports from the Massachusetts state government. The reports are released on this web page: https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-cases-quarantine-and-monitoring

They keep adding columns, and so the csv does too. My apologies if it breaks your code.
